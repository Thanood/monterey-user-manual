_Creating new application_
# GitHub

**[GitHub](https://github.com)** based repositories are currently the richest source of templates and finished Aurelia applications for Monterey. The [Contact manager tutorial](../creating_new_application/contact_manager_tutorial.html) is a good example demonstrating this approach.

Initially we provided the simplest possible implementation of the GitHub browser (Image 2 below), used to fetch the desired application folder. You need to know the [GitHub URL](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/cm-bridges) (Image 1 below, marker 1)

When you paste the URL into GitHub URL field (marker 1), you will see the folder named `original` appear in the pulldown box (marker 2) show up.

<br> Selecting the `Subfolder` entry completely defines the application - Monterey will fetch it from Github for subsequent processing.

See the **[Contact manager tutorial](./contact_manager_tutorial.html)** article for more details about this approach.
