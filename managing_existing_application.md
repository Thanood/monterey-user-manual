# Managing existing application

We believe that it is too early to commit to a set of specific strategies for managing existing application - we are awaiting on the feedback from the initial Monterey release (see **[Installing Monterey chapter](./installing_monterey.html)** for information how to get the installer and run it).

While one could consider the **[Contact manager tutorial](./creating_new_application/contact_manager_tutorial.html)** an example of how to manage an existing Aurelia application - precisely speaking, this example only shows how to build and run ana Aurelia application persisted in GitHub.
