# A brief peek in the future of Monterey

### 1. Configuration management
There is a rumor that Monterey started as Aurelia Configuration Tool (aka ACT), application designed to assist Aurelia developers with tedious and complex pedestrian work associated with configuration details of module managers like **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)** and module loaders like **[jspm](http://jspm.io/)** and **[webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/)**.

While Monterey is a lot more complex tool today (see **[What is Monterey](../introduction/what_is_monterey.html)** for details), application configuration assistence is one of the key Monterey features (see **[npm manager](../features/npm_manager.html)** and **[jspm manager](../features/jspm_manager.html)** for details) in the context of Aurelia applications management.

Here are a few ideas from the general area of configuration management we are considering at the moment

- Upgrading an existing application to the next version of Aurelia.
- Downgrading an existing application to some previous version of Aurelia (say for debugging purposes)
