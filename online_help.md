# Online help

The most basic definition of Monterey is very simple (as stated in the [README.md file](https://github.com/monterey-framework/monterey/blob/master/README.md) of the [Monterey GitHub repository](https://github.com/monterey-framework/monterey): 

> Monterey is an extensible application that provides a graphical user interface for a collection of tools to simplify the creation, configuration and maintenance of Aurelia applications.
<br>

Upon more inspection, the interested user will soon get the impression that it is a complex tool being able to do many very different things:

- [Creating new Aurelia applications using either Aurelia-CLI generator or a set of prebuilt application skeletons](./content/creating_new_application.html).

- Managing the process of application building and running with built in features like
  - [NPM Manager](./content/features/npm_manager.html)
  - [JSPM manager](./content/features/jspm_manager.html)
  - [Webpack manager](./content/features/webpack.html)


- Defining the details of application build process
  - [Gulp manager]()
  - [Task manager]()
  - [Workflow manager]()

as well as several other services that are still under the development. So, the AureliaTools team has spent a lot of time to provide several different types of documentation of documentation starting with this very document - Monterey user manual.

Knowing that there is a significant "class" of software developers would do not like to read extensive manuals and prefer to dive "right in", by starting the Monterey and look around by clicking on any part of Monterey user interface, we added two more "entries" into the help system:

### 1. Live tour of the User Interface

This is the initial view of Monterey started for the first time: you are prompted by the "tour manager" which covers most UI objects on this (main) view.
