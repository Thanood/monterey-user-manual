The Aurelia-CLI template is intentionally on the first place as it is the most popular method for Aurelia application creation, despite its initial limitation to support a single module loader (RequireJS). In order to maximize the power if Aurelia-CLI, Monterey completely depends on this tool, acting as its Visual "proxy" - a fact that any existing Aurelia-CLI user will immediately recognize while providing the answers to Monterey presenting the application creation Wizard.
